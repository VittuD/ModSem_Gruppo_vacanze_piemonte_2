        "description": "Cornwell was born in London in 1944. His father was a Canadian airman, and his mother, who was English, a member of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. He was adopted and brought up in Essex by the Wiggins family, who were members of the Peculiar People, a strict Protestant sect who banned frivolity of all kinds and even medicine. After he left them, he changed his name to his birth mother's maiden name, Cornwell.<br /><br />Cornwell was sent away to Monkton Combe School, attended the University of London, and after graduating, worked as a teacher. He attempted to enlist in the British armed services at least three times but was rejected on the grounds of myopia.<br /><br />He then joined BBC's Nationwide and was promoted to become head of current affairs at BBC Northern Ireland. He then joined Thames Television as editor of Thames News. He relocated to the United States in 1980 after marrying an American. Unable to get a green card, he started writing novels, as this did not require a work permit.<br /><br />As a child, Cornwell loved the novels of C.S. Forester, chronicling the adventures of fictional British naval officer Horatio Hornblower during the Napoleonic Wars, and was surprised to find there were no such novels following Lord Wellington's campaign on land. Motivated by the need to support himself in the U.S. through writing, Cornwell decided to write such a series. He named his chief protagonist Richard Sharpe, a rifleman involved in most major battles of the Peninsular War.<br /><br />Cornwell wanted to start the series with the Siege of Badajoz but decided instead to start with a couple of \"warm-up\" novels. These were <i>Sharpe's Eagle</i> and <i>Sharpe's Gold</i>, both published in 1981. <i>Sharpe's Eagle</i> was picked up by a publisher, and Cornwell got a three-book deal. He went on to tell the story of Badajoz in his third Sharpe novel, <i>Sharpe's Company</i>, published in 1982.<br /><br />Cornwell and wife Judy co-wrote a series of novels, published under the pseudonym \"Susannah Kells\". These were <i>A Crowning Mercy</i>, published in 1983, <i>Fallen Angels</i> in 1984, and <i>Coat of Arms</i> (aka <i>The Aristocrats</i>) in 1986. (Cornwell's strict Protestant upbringing informed the background of <i>A Crowning Mercy</i>, which took place during the English Civil War.) In 1987, he also published <i>Redcoat</i>, an American Revolutionary War novel set in Philadelphia during its 1777 occupation by the British.<br /><br />After publishing eight books in his ongoing Sharpe series, Cornwell was approached by a production company interested in adapting them for television. The producers asked him to write a prequel to give them a starting point to the series. They also requested that the story feature a large role for Spanish characters to secure co-funding from Spain. The result was <i>Sharpe\u2019s Rifles</i>, published in 1987, and a series of Sharpe television films staring Sean Bean.<br /><br />A series of contemporary thrillers with sailing as a background and common themes followed: <i>Wildtrack</i> published in 1988, <i>Sea Lord</i> (aka <i>Killer's Wake</i>) in 1989, <i>Crackdown</i> in 1990, <i>Stormchild</i> in 1991, and <i>Scoundrel</i>, a political thriller, in 1992.<br /><br />In June 2006, Cornwell was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's 80th Birthday Honours List.<br /><br />Cornwell's latest work, <i>Azincourt</i>, was released in the UK in October 2008. The protagonist is an archer who participates in the Battle of Agincourt, another devastating defeat suffered by the French in the Hundred Years War. However, Cornwell has stated that it will not be about Thomas of Hookton from The Grail Quest or any of his relatives.",

She was the daughter of English-born naturalist and pioneer of the Boy Scouts of America, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/31707.Ernest_Thompson_Seton\" title=\"Ernest Thompson Seton\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ernest Thompson Seton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3916395.Grace_Gallatin_Seton_Thompson\" title=\"Grace Gallatin Seton-Thompson\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Grace Gallatin Seton-Thompson</a>. She is interred at Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich.<br /><br />Her historical novels were noted for how extensively she researched the historical facts, and some of them were best-sellers.[citation needed] Dragonwyck (1941) and Foxfire (1950) were both made into Hollywood films. Two of her books are classics in their genre and continue in their popularity to the present; Katherine, the story of Katherine Swynford, the mistress and eventual wife of John of Gaunt, and their children, who eventually became the basis for the Tudor and Stuart families of England, and Green Darkness, the story of a modern couple plagued by their past life incarnations. Most of her novels have been recently republished, several with forewords by Philippa Gregory.<br /><br />Her novel Devil Water concerns James, the luckless Earl of Derwentwater and his involvement with the Jacobite rising of 1715. She also narrates the story of his brother Charles, beheaded after the 1745 rebellion, the last man to die for the cause. The action of the novel moves back and forth between Northumberland, Tyneside, London and America.<br /><br />Anya Seton stated that the book developed out of her love for Northumberland. Anya certainly visited her Snowdon cousins at Felton. Billy Pigg, the celebrated Northumbrian piper played 'Derwentwater's Farewell' especially for her. The novel shows her typical thorough research of events and places, though the accents are a little wayward. Anya Seton said that her greatest debt of all was to Miss Amy Flagg of Westoe Village in South Shields, her father's birthplace.",

        "description": "Cornwell was born in London in 1944. His father was a Canadian airman, and his mother, who was English, a member of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. He was adopted and brought up in Essex by the Wiggins family, who were members of the Peculiar People, a strict Protestant sect who banned frivolity of all kinds and even medicine. After he left them, he changed his name to his birth mother's maiden name, Cornwell.<br /><br />Cornwell was sent away to Monkton Combe School, attended the University of London, and after graduating, worked as a teacher. He attempted to enlist in the British armed services at least three times but was rejected on the grounds of myopia.<br /><br />He then joined BBC's Nationwide and was promoted to become head of current affairs at BBC Northern Ireland. He then joined Thames Television as editor of Thames News. He relocated to the United States in 1980 after marrying an American. Unable to get a green card, he started writing novels, as this did not require a work permit.<br /><br />As a child, Cornwell loved the novels of C.S. Forester, chronicling the adventures of fictional British naval officer Horatio Hornblower during the Napoleonic Wars, and was surprised to find there were no such novels following Lord Wellington's campaign on land. Motivated by the need to support himself in the U.S. through writing, Cornwell decided to write such a series. He named his chief protagonist Richard Sharpe, a rifleman involved in most major battles of the Peninsular War.<br /><br />Cornwell wanted to start the series with the Siege of Badajoz but decided instead to start with a couple of \"warm-up\" novels. These were <i>Sharpe's Eagle</i> and <i>Sharpe's Gold</i>, both published in 1981. <i>Sharpe's Eagle</i> was picked up by a publisher, and Cornwell got a three-book deal. He went on to tell the story of Badajoz in his third Sharpe novel, <i>Sharpe's Company</i>, published in 1982.<br /><br />Cornwell and wife Judy co-wrote a series of novels, published under the pseudonym \"Susannah Kells\". These were <i>A Crowning Mercy</i>, published in 1983, <i>Fallen Angels</i> in 1984, and <i>Coat of Arms</i> (aka <i>The Aristocrats</i>) in 1986. (Cornwell's strict Protestant upbringing informed the background of <i>A Crowning Mercy</i>, which took place during the English Civil War.) In 1987, he also published <i>Redcoat</i>, an American Revolutionary War novel set in Philadelphia during its 1777 occupation by the British.<br /><br />After publishing eight books in his ongoing Sharpe series, Cornwell was approached by a production company interested in adapting them for television. The producers asked him to write a prequel to give them a starting point to the series. They also requested that the story feature a large role for Spanish characters to secure co-funding from Spain. The result was <i>Sharpe\u2019s Rifles</i>, published in 1987, and a series of Sharpe television films staring Sean Bean.<br /><br />A series of contemporary thrillers with sailing as a background and common themes followed: <i>Wildtrack</i> published in 1988, <i>Sea Lord</i> (aka <i>Killer's Wake</i>) in 1989, <i>Crackdown</i> in 1990, <i>Stormchild</i> in 1991, and <i>Scoundrel</i>, a political thriller, in 1992.<br /><br />In June 2006, Cornwell was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's 80th Birthday Honours List.<br /><br />Cornwell's latest work, <i>Azincourt</i>, was released in the UK in October 2008. The protagonist is an archer who participates in the Battle of Agincourt, another devastating defeat suffered by the French in the Hundred Years War. However, Cornwell has stated that it will not be about Thomas of Hookton from The Grail Quest or any of his relatives.",

Iggulden</a>.</i><br /><br />I was born in the normal way in 1971, and vaguely remember half-pennies and sixpences. I have written for as long as I can remember: poetry, short stories and novels. It\u2019s what I always wanted to do and read English at London University with writing in mind. I taught English for seven years and was Head of English at St. Gregory\u2019s RC High School in London by the end of that period. I have enormous respect for those who still labour at the chalk-face. In truth, I can\u2019t find it in me to miss the grind of paperwork and initiatives. I do miss the camaraderie of the smokers\u2019 room, as well as the lessons where their faces lit up as they understood what I was wittering on about.<br /><br />My mother is Irish and from an early age she told me history as an exciting series of stories \u2013 with dates. My great-grandfather was a Seannachie, so I suppose story-telling is in the genes somewhere. My father flew in Bomber Command in WWII, then taught maths and science. Perhaps crucially, he also loved poetry and cracking good tales. Though it seems a dated idea now, I began teaching when boys were told only girls were good at English, despite the great names that must spring to mind after that statement. My father loved working with wood and equations, but he also recited \u2018Vitai Lampada\u2019 with a gleam in his eye and that matters, frankly.<br /><br />I\u2019ve always loved historical fiction as a genre and cut my teeth on Hornblower and Tai-Pan, Flashman, Sharpe and Jack Aubrey. I still remember the sheer joy of reading my first Patrick O\u2019Brian book and discovering there were nineteen more in the series. I love just about anything by David Gemmell, or Peter F. Hamilton or Wilbur Smith. I suppose the one thing that links all those is the love of a good tale.<br /><br />That\u2019s about it for the moment. If you\u2019d like to get in touch with me leave a comment in the forum or you can tweet me @Conn_Iggulden. I\u2019ll leave it there for the moment. If you\u2019ve read my books, you know an awful lot about the way I think already. There\u2019s no point overdoing it.<br /><br />Conn Iggulden<br />",
