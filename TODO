- |X|   We could have 3 different forms based on the scraped jsons:
        1. Form for Book (Edizione)
        2. Form for Work (OperaLetteraria)
        3. Form for Contributor (Autore o Traduttore)
        For this we need to split each json in 3 different jsons.
Response: we will have only 2 forms, one for Book and one for Contributor
- |X|   We gotta find some difference between Editore and CasaEditrice bc the json only provides the latter
- |X|   We could use ALSO json in the sparql query since sparql anything supports it
- |X|   Topic doesn't really looks like the center piece, we need to make something up to justify it
- |X|   Remove top-level topics from all topics so that top level is genre and all is topic
