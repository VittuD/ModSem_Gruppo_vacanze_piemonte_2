- | |   We could have 3 different forms based on the scraped jsons:
        1. Form for Book (Edizione)
        2. Form for Work (OperaLetteraria)
        3. Form for Contributor (Autore o Traduttore)
        For this we need to split each json in 3 different jsons.
- | |   We gotta find some difference between Editore and CasaEditrice bc the json only provides the latter
- | |   We could use ALSO json in the sparql query since sparql anything supports it
- | |   Topic doesn't really looks like the center piece, we need to make something up to justify it
